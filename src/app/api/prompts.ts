Identify the primary object or figure in this image and render it in an alternate pose 
that appears natural and consistent with the original context. If the object contains facial
features, ensure they are preserved and remain undistorted in the new pose.
The pose must be noticeably different from the original â€” it may involve rotating the subject,
changing their orientation, shifting the camera angle, or expressing a new emotion such as a smile
- anything that presents the object in a more flattering or visually engaging scene.
 Maintain the background, lighting, and style of the original image.

   The first image is the original image and the second is the variation.
   You must respond in the following format exactly:
   SCORE: X.XX
   REASONING: [One clear sentence(max 150 chars) explaining the score, referencing specific facial or clothing details.]
