## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- Next.js
- React with Server Components
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling

**Backend:**
- fal.ai for AI video generation
- OpenAI GPT-4.1 for quality scoring
- FFmpeg for frame extraction
- AWS S3 for file storage

**Infrastructure:**
- S3 for Terraform state storage and image storage
- AWS IAM for communication with S3
- AWS App Runner for deployment
- AWS ECR for container registry of Docker images
- Terraform for Infrastructure as Code
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## API Endpoints

### Generate Frames
```http
POST /api/generate-frames
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

{
  "image": File
}

**Response:**
```json
{
  "frames": [
    {
      "url": "https://s3-presigned-url...",
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "High quality frame with good pose variation..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Security Features

- **Presigned URLs**: Secure, time-limited S3 access
- **Input Validation**: File type and size verification
- **Error Sanitization**: Safe error message exposure
- **Environment Isolation**: Secure credential management


## Deployment
The application is deployed using GitHub Actions and AWS App Runner. Here's the workflow:

### Container Workflow
1. **Build**: GitHub Actions builds Docker image
2. **Push**: Image pushed to AWS ECR
3. **Deploy**: App Runner pulls from ECR automatically and deploys

### Infrastructure
All infrastructure is managed via Terraform except for app runner that change configuration after deployment.
First image on ecr need to be deployed to ecr before app runner can be deployed.

### Disclaimers
This project has a variety of areas that can be improved, and several came to my mind as I was developing it. Here are a few examples:
1. The project uses an AWS role instead of a user, which is not best practice, but was done to enable deployment to Vercel, for example.
2. Error handling does not follow best practices and is a work in progress.
3. The app has not been tested on different devices and browsers, though it is designed to look good on mobile as well.
4. Tests are missing and type definitions are not perfect.
5. The frontend component structure can be improved.
6. Key features such as authentication, user management, and others are missing.
